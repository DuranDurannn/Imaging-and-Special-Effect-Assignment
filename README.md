## Instruction for Running the Program
1. Make sure all needed library are installed
2. Please run the code in *main.ipynb* first
3. Then run *pic1_main.py* for compiling the picture in scene 1
4. Run *extract_FBF.py* for the animation frame to be created
5. Run *video.py* to compile the picture with the frame that was generated

## Important
- All files final output is generated in the output file
- Please follow the instruction above to avoid program failing
- *extract_FBF.py* and *video.py* cant run in Jupyter Notebook for some reason thats why it is seperated from the main file
- *pic1_main.py* is to standardized the code
